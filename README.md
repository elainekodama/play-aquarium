# Virtual Aquarium
 
This is an aquarium game where users can buy and sell fish and plants to grow their aquatic community.
The longer you keep fish alive, the more valuable they become, and more expensive fish can be bought!

Utilizes the JavaFX framework and object-oriented and MVC design pattern.

Run PlayAquarium.java to start the game, buy your first fish and plant to start making coins!

This game was made as part of a GUI class assignment; all media was drawn by me
